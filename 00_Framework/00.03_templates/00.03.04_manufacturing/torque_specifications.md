## Torque Application Procedure

### Step 1: Preparation

1. **Verify Fastener Specifications:**
   - Thread: M6x1.0-6H (internal) / M6x1.0-6g (external)
   - Material: Grade 8.8 or better
   - Length: As specified per application

2. **Prepare Thread Locking Compound:**
   - Use Loctite 243 or equivalent
   - Apply to threads before installation
   - Follow manufacturer's instructions

3. **Verify Torque Wrench:**
   - Calibrated torque wrench required
   - Range: 0-20 N⋅m (covers 8-10 N⋅m range)
   - Verify calibration date (within 12 months)

### Step 2: Installation

1. **Hand-Tight Installation:**
   - Install fastener hand-tight first
   - Verify proper engagement
   - Do not cross-thread

2. **Initial Torque:**
   - Apply 50% of target torque (4-5 N⋅m)
   - Verify fastener is seating properly
   - Check for any binding or interference

3. **Final Torque:**
   - Apply full torque (8-10 N⋅m)
   - Use smooth, steady motion
   - Do not exceed maximum torque (10 N⋅m)

### Step 3: Verification

1. **Torque Verification:**
   - Verify torque was applied correctly
   - Check for any loose fasteners
   - Re-torque if necessary

2. **Visual Inspection:**
   - Verify fastener is properly seated
   - Check for any damage to threads
   - Verify thread locking compound is present

## Thread Locking Compound

**Product:** Loctite 243 (or equivalent)

**Application:**
- Apply to clean, dry threads
- Apply sufficient amount to cover threads
- Do not apply to fastener head

**Curing Time:**
- Initial cure: 10 minutes
- Full cure: 24 hours
- Do not disturb during curing period

**Removal:**
- Use standard tools
- May require heat for removal (if necessary)
- Clean threads after removal

## Safety Notes

1. **Personal Protective Equipment:**
   - Safety glasses required
   - Gloves recommended

2. **Tool Safety:**
   - Use torque wrench only for intended purpose
   - Do not use as breaker bar
   - Store properly after use

3. **Application Safety:**
   - Apply torque smoothly
   - Do not exceed maximum torque
   - Verify fastener engagement before applying torque
