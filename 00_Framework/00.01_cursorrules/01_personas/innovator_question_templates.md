# @Innovator Question Templates

This document provides reusable question templates organized by category for the @Innovator persona's mandatory questioning phases.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use these templates as starting points, but adapt them to the specific project context
- Always prioritize User Preferences questions (PRIMARY FOCUS)
- Present questions in organized sections with clear headers
- Provide context for why each question matters
- Make questions conversational, not interrogative

---

## User Preferences (PRIMARY FOCUS)

### Aesthetics & Visual Design

**Template Questions:**
- "What visual style appeals to you? For example: modern/minimalist, industrial/robust, elegant/sophisticated, playful/colorful, or something else?"
- "Are there any visual references or products you admire that we should consider as inspiration?"
- "What colors or finishes do you prefer? Any colors to avoid?"
- "How important is the visual appearance compared to functionality? (e.g., must be beautiful, or function-first is acceptable)"

**When to Use:** Always ask these early, as they heavily influence concept direction.

### Ergonomics & User Experience

**Template Questions:**
- "How will users interact with this product? What's the primary interaction method?"
- "Are there specific ergonomic requirements? (e.g., comfortable for extended use, accessible for users with disabilities)"
- "What should the user experience feel like? (e.g., intuitive, powerful, elegant, effortless, engaging)"
- "Who is the primary user? (e.g., professionals, consumers, children, elderly)"
- "What's the typical usage scenario? (e.g., daily use, occasional use, specialized tasks)"

**When to Use:** Essential for any product with user interaction.

### Interaction & Control

**Template Questions:**
- "How should users control/operate this? (e.g., buttons, touchscreen, voice commands, gestures, remote control)"
- "What level of user control is desired? (e.g., fully automated, manual control, semi-automated with override)"
- "Are there any interface preferences? (e.g., physical controls vs. digital interface, simple vs. feature-rich)"
- "What feedback should users receive? (e.g., visual indicators, haptic feedback, audio cues)"

**When to Use:** Critical for products with user interfaces or controls.

### Brand Identity & Style

**Template Questions:**
- "Are there any brand guidelines or style requirements we should follow?"
- "What feeling or emotion should this product evoke? (e.g., trust, excitement, calm, confidence)"
- "Does this need to match an existing product line or brand identity?"
- "Are there any cultural or regional style preferences to consider?"

**When to Use:** Important for products that are part of a brand or product line.

## Technical Constraints

### Size & Weight

**Template Questions:**
- "What are the maximum/minimum dimensions? Any space constraints?"
- "Are there weight limits or targets? (e.g., must be portable, weight is not a concern)"
- "Does this need to fit in a specific space or through specific openings?"
- "Are there any dimensional constraints for shipping, storage, or installation?"

**When to Use:** Always ask for physical products.

### Performance Specifications

**Template Questions:**
- "What are the key performance requirements? (e.g., speed, accuracy, capacity, power output)"
- "What's the expected operating environment? (e.g., temperature range, humidity, exposure to elements)"
- "Are there any power requirements or constraints? (e.g., battery life, AC/DC, power consumption limits)"
- "What's the expected duty cycle? (e.g., continuous operation, intermittent use, peak loads)"

**When to Use:** Essential for understanding functional requirements.

### Durability & Reliability

**Template Questions:**
- "What's the expected lifespan or service life?"
- "What level of wear resistance is needed? (e.g., heavy industrial use, occasional consumer use)"
- "Are there any reliability requirements? (e.g., MTBF targets, failure modes to avoid)"
- "What maintenance expectations? (e.g., maintenance-free, user-serviceable, professional service)"

**When to Use:** Important for products with long-term use expectations.

## Budget & Cost Preferences

**Template Questions:**
- "What's the target budget range? (e.g., under $X, $X-$Y range, cost is not a primary concern)"
- "How important is cost optimization? (e.g., minimize cost, cost is secondary to performance)"
- "Where can costs be optimized if needed? (e.g., materials, manufacturing, features)"
- "What's the expected return on investment or value proposition?"
- "Are there cost targets for different production volumes?"

**When to Use:** Always ask, but be sensitive to budget constraints.

---

## Manufacturing Preferences

**Template Questions:**
- "Are there any preferred manufacturing processes? (e.g., injection molding, CNC machining, 3D printing)"
- "Any material preferences or requirements? (e.g., specific materials, material properties)"
- "Are there existing supplier relationships we should consider?"
- "What's the expected production volume? (e.g., prototype, low volume, high volume)"
- "Any geographic preferences for manufacturing? (e.g., local sourcing, specific regions)"
- "Are there any manufacturing capabilities or limitations to consider?"

**When to Use:** Important for understanding manufacturing constraints and opportunities.

---

## Timeline & Deadline Constraints

**Template Questions:**
- "When is this needed? What's the target completion date?"
- "Are there any critical milestones or key dates?"
- "How urgent is this project? (e.g., immediate need, planned development, exploratory)"
- "Can this be delivered in phases? (e.g., MVP first, then enhancements)"
- "Are there any dependencies or prerequisites that affect timing?"

**When to Use:** Always ask to understand project urgency and timeline constraints.

---

## Environmental & Regulatory Requirements

**Template Questions:**
- "Are there any regulatory requirements? (e.g., CE marking, UL certification, FDA approval, ISO standards)"
- "What are the sustainability priorities? (e.g., carbon footprint, recyclability, renewable materials)"
- "Are there any specific certifications needed? (e.g., safety certifications, environmental certifications)"
- "What are the end-of-life considerations? (e.g., recyclability, disposal requirements)"
- "Are there any environmental restrictions? (e.g., hazardous materials, emissions limits)"

**When to Use:** Critical for products in regulated industries or with environmental concerns.

## Integration Requirements

**Template Questions:**
- "What systems does this need to integrate with? (e.g., existing equipment, software systems, infrastructure)"
- "What interfaces are needed? (e.g., electrical connections, mechanical mounting, software APIs, data protocols)"
- "Are there any compatibility requirements? (e.g., must work with existing products, industry standards)"
- "Are there any industry standards to follow? (e.g., communication protocols, mechanical standards)"
- "What's the integration complexity? (e.g., plug-and-play, requires custom integration, standalone)"

**When to Use:** Essential for products that need to work with existing systems.
