# Session Logging (Mandatory)

At the end of *every* significant turn or task completion, you (the AI) must append a summary to `logs/session_log.md` in the following format:

```markdown
| Date | Role | Task | Outcome/Files Created |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [YYYY-MM-DD] | [@RoleName] | [Short Description] | [List of files] |
```

## Logging Requirements

- Log every significant task completion
- Include date, role, task description, and files created
- Use markdown table format
- Maintain chronological order
- File location: `logs/session_log.md`
