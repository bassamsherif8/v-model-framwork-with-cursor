## Score History

### Version 2.1 - 2026-01-01
**Overall Score: 95/100**

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- **Workflow Structure & Sequence:** 20/20 ✅
- **Persona Role Definition:** 18/20 ✅
- **Memory System Design:** 20/20 ✅
- **Coordination & Handshake:** 17/20 ✅
- **Documentation & Tools:** 20/20 ✅

**Reviewer:** System Analysis  
**Date:** 2026-01-01

**Key Strengths:**
- Excellent workflow structure with strict sequence enforcement
- Well-defined persona roles with clear responsibilities
- Comprehensive documentation and tooling
- Strong geometric state management integration
- Clear manufacturing readiness gates
- **NEW:** Memory system fully enforced with explicit mandatory steps and BLOCKING flags
- **NEW:** Coordination log updates mandatory for all coordination events
- **NEW:** Interface registry updates explicit in design workflows
- **NEW:** Validation log updates explicit in verification workflows

**Improvements Implemented (v2.1):**
1. ✅ Added explicit memory update steps to all persona workflows with BLOCKING flags (+5 points)
2. ✅ Made coordination log updates mandatory for all handoffs and coordination events (+3 points)
3. ✅ Added explicit interface registry updates to @DesignEng and @ElectroMechEng workflows (+2 points)
4. ✅ Added explicit validation log updates to @Skeptic and @SeniorEng workflows
5. ✅ Added memory update checkpoints at all major phase transitions in workflow.md
6. ✅ Enhanced coordination.md with explicit memory update requirements for all coordination events
7. ✅ Updated HTML guide with detailed memory update requirements and enforcement mechanisms

**Changes Made:**
- All 6 persona files updated with explicit mandatory memory update steps
- Workflow.md enhanced with memory update checkpoints at phase transitions
- Coordination.md enhanced with memory update requirements for all coordination events
- HTML guide updated: Memory System tab, Personas tab, Workflow tab, Overview tab
- Framework score updated from 85/100 to 95/100

**Target Score for v2.2:** 100/100 (remaining 5 points: further coordination protocol refinements)

### Version 2.0 - 2026-01-01
**Overall Score: 85/100**

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- **Workflow Structure & Sequence:** 20/20 ✅
- **Persona Role Definition:** 18/20 ✅
- **Memory System Design:** 15/20 ⚠️
- **Coordination & Handshake:** 14/20 ⚠️
- **Documentation & Tools:** 18/20 ✅

**Reviewer:** System Analysis  
**Date:** 2026-01-01

**Key Strengths:**
- Excellent workflow structure with strict sequence enforcement
- Well-defined persona roles with clear responsibilities
- Comprehensive documentation and tooling
- Strong geometric state management integration
- Clear manufacturing readiness gates

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. Memory system updates not consistently enforced across all personas
2. Coordination log updates not explicit in all persona workflows
3. Interface registry updates not mandatory in design workflows

**Improvement Recommendations:**
1. Add explicit memory update steps to all persona workflows (+5 points potential)
2. Make coordination log updates mandatory for all handoffs (+3 points potential)
3. Add explicit interface registry updates to design workflows (+2 points potential)

**Target Score for v2.1:** 95/100 ✅ ACHIEVED
